--> Downstream of Data Analysis and Machine Learning

### Research Objectives:
 To develop automated pipeline for data wrangling (data gathering, data cleaning and data 
structuring) and selecting the best model out of pre-defined multiple models during training for 
the production environment.
 Optimization of the created or existed pipeline.
 Evaluation and documentation of the results.
